## About
##### Elixir Nonprofit is creating a mobile application to provide information about free and low-cost healthcare clinics to users across Washington State. We want to make getting medical attention more accessible for everyone by providing the tools for people to take hold of resources in their area. As an organization we believe everyone deserves the opportunity to seek medical attention, but have experienced that this is not always readily accessible. Our product will change that by giving more communities active roles in healthcare and giving individuals the agency they need to be confident in seeking help.

## Features
### Our product will have three core features:
- The ability for users to search affordable clinics in their area by location and service tags through maps.
- An accurate and updated list of free and low-cost health centers and clinics in a database accessible to users through the mobile application.
- An individual view for each clinic we mention which will include information such as the clinic's name, hours, location, and contact information.

### Other features we hope to implement:
- A review system that allows users to publicly and anonymously share their experiences with clinics, including the clinic’s type of care and position on checking patient documentation.
- The ability for users to interact with the app in their own native language.
- Allowing clinics to update their own information regarding location, services offered, etc. in their listing, and also allows new clinics to onboard and make their services known to app users.

## Impact
##### Though anyone can use our application, our product is most intended to serve communities who lack resources such as education, funding, and access to healthcare. Elixir Nonprofit will equip people in these communities with the power to pave the way for a healthier future for themselves and for their families.

## Timeline
##### We aim to release an initial version of the app with the core features described above on the Google Play store by the end of September.
